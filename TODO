Raggle TODO
===========
[*] scrolling
[*] sanitize window modes (remove text reflow from draw())
[ ] clean up code (move methods to modules, eliminate globals, etc)
[ ] modularize code to make it suitable for reuse
[*] finish inline documentation
[*] command-line options
[*] feed grab save existing items
[*] speed up feed cache loading
[*] theme shouldn't save hard-coded window coordinates
[*] scrolling in Description window
[ ] fix blocking for feed grabbing (grab feeds in parallel?)
[*] better theme format
[ ] Convert manpage (raggle.1) to -ms
[ ] Window resizing.
    Take a copy of ['theme']['window'], so we can resize without
    messing up the initial sizes (they need to be changed so
    resize_term knows what to do (not really, but still).
    We need to know *where* the windows are.
    For instance, in the default config, narrowing "Feeds" means
    widening the other two windows, and such.  This is all possible,
    right now.  But takes surgery, which can wait until morning, if
    you read this more than a week after I commit it, email me and
    tell me to at the very least ammend this, to say why it's taken so long
[ ] Add a focus mode 'focus_smart'(?) that will select a feed when you
    flip from feeds into items (such that you don't have one feed by all
    visual accounts "Highlighted", but the items from another, since
    just because a feed is highlighted, doesn't mean it's *selected*
    too (though possibly it should, but that's what this is all about).
[*] Add an option ('force_reflow') that will forcibly wrap lines that
    would otherwise evade it (by not having spaces in it, say).
[ ] When selecting a feed, automatically (and optionally) select the
    first item in the feed.
[ ] OPML import/export support (http://www.opml.org/)
[ ] RSS locator (see link from http://www.pablotron.org/?cid=1154)
[ ] item delete, mark items as unread, stick (save, hilite?) items, etc
[ ] proxy support (via ENV['HTTP_PROXY'], etc?)
[ ] display / dump raw feed output
[ ] conditional HTTP GET to reduce bandwidth use and increase speed
[ ] "update this feed now!" option from within Raggle
[ ] 'manual_update' option and keybinding for modem lusers
[ ] Select Next Unread (n), should work for feeds as well as items
[ ] Previous unread item would be useful also (I don't read in order, always)
[ ] Reverse ordering, (on a key) so you can read a big chunk of new
    items in chronological order (most are reverse chron) without
    undue discomfort
[ ] Full HTML support is hard, but we at least need to do the right
    thing with <PRE>, this is entirely possible within String#reflow
    o Remove all calls to strip_tags (and have Window#text_draw do it
      *after* the reflow)
    o Watche for <pre[^>]*> </pre[^>]*> in String#reflow
    o Prevent reflow when between the two tags, just pass it word for
      word to text, sticking a \n in when one appears (which you can't
      see, because of the way #reflow is implemented, hence why I'm
      not doing it.
