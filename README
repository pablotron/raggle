Introduction
============
Raggle is a console RSS (RDF Site Summary) aggregator, written in Ruby
(http://www.ruby-lang.org/).  Raggle has been tested under Linux and
OpenBSD, and should work properly with various RSS versions.  If this is
the first time you've used Raggle, please read the "Getting Started"
section below for a brief overview of the keyboard controls.


System Requirements
===================
* Ruby, version 1.6.8 (or newer), or 1.8.0-preview3 (or newer):
  http://www.ruby-lang.org/
* REXML, version 2.4.0 (or newer) (included in Ruby 1.8.x):
  http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/
* NCurses-Ruby, version 0.7.1 (or newer):
  http://ncurses-ruby.berlios.de/
* YAML support
  Either:
    o YAML-Ruby, version 0.49.1 (or newer):
      http://www.yaml.org/ 
    o Syck, version 0.35 (included in Ruby 1.8.x)
      http://whytheluckystiff.net/syck/ 

Raggle will run properly in an 80x25 terminal, but a slightly larger
terminal (say, 80x35 or 80x40) is recommended.


Installation
============
The easiest way to install raggle is to use the included Makefile.  This
will install the Raggle executable in a system-wide executable
directory, install the Raggle documentation, and install the Raggle
themes.  Here's the command:

  # install raggle, raggle docs, and raggle data
  sudo make install

or (if you don't use sudo):

  # install raggle (but you don't use sudo; tsk tsk)
  su -c 'make install'

or (if you just want the executable):

  # install raggle (just the apps, ma'am)
  su -c 'cp ./raggle /usr/local/bin/'

or (if you don't have root access, and only want it for personal use):

  # copy raggle to your personal executable directory
  cp raggle $HOME/bin/


Getting Started
===============
The Raggle display is divided into three windows: the Feed window (along
the left side of the screen), the Item window (in the top-right corner),
and the Description window (in the bottom-right corner).  The Feed
window contains a list of RSS feeds you're currently subscribed to.
I've included a handful of sample feeds to get you started raggling.  If
you'd like more feeds, copy my feed list from "doc/pauls_feeds.yaml" to
your raggle directory with the following command:

  # try out a big feed list
  cp doc/pauls_feeds.yaml $HOME/.raggle/feeds.yaml

Alternatively, there are several RSS feed directory and search engine
links in the "Related Links" section below.

Working with Raggle is simple.  Use the left and right arrow keys to
navigate between windows.  Press Enter or Space to select the highlighted
item in the active window.  To launch a browser and view an item, select
the item, navigate to the Description window and press Enter.  Several
additional keyboard commands are described in the Raggle feed in Raggle,
and in the Raggle man page.

Here's how you add a new RSS feed to Raggle:

  # add a new feed to raggle
  raggle --add --title "title" --url "url" --refresh "refresh"

Where "title" is a title for the RSS feed, "url" is the URL to the RSS
feed, and "refresh" is the number of minutes between each refresh.  A
complete list of feed editing commands available from the command-line
is available in the Raggle man page, or by typing "raggle --help".

And that's it!  If you have any questions or comments about Raggle, feel
free to email either Richard or myself; our email addresses are
available in the "About the Authors" section below.


Configuration Files
===================
  $HOME/.raggle/config.rb          - main configuration file
  $HOME/.raggle/feeds.yaml         - feed list
  $HOME/.raggle/feed_cache.store   - cached feed items
  $HOME/.raggle/theme.yaml         - colors, window layout

Raggle will fall back to internal defaults if any of these files are
deleted, or if they don't exist.  The feed list, feed cache, and theme
files are automatically regenerated by Raggle; the main configuration
file is not (although it is not required).  If you'd like to change
Raggle defaults, copy the default configuration file from
"doc/default_config.rb" to your raggle directory with the following
command:

  # copy config to your raggle directory
  cp doc/default_config.rb $HOME/.raggle/config.rb
