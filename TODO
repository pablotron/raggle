Raggle TODO
===========
[*] scrolling
[ ] sanitize window modes (remove text reflow from draw())
[ ] clean up code (move methods to modules, eliminate globals, etc)
[ ] modularize code to make it suitable for reuse
[ ] finish inline documentation
[*] command-line options
[*] feed grab save existing items
[*] speed up feed cache loading
[*] theme shouldn't save hard-coded window coordinates
[ ] scrolling in Description window
[ ] fix blocking for feed grabbing (grab feeds in parallel?)
[ ] Convert manpage (raggle.1) to -ms
[ ] Add window resizing (needs the theme/window shit to be overhawled,
    at a guess)
