[*] Description doesn't scroll
[-] Feed grabbing thread will block if the HTTP connection blocks 
    (work in progress)
[ ] Sometimes (totally unreproducibly), the feeds file will be saved
    is the FeedList were an array, (not reproducible here)
[ ] Code *very* untidy in places, (will be fixed post-release)
[ ] Man page is worthlessly incomplete
[ ] It's possible that sometimes the inline documentation ("Raggle"
    feed) items aren't created from the default list (We can't even
    decide if this is really happenening or not.
[ ] I can *still* convince some feeds to flow description out of the
    window.  Unfortunately, the '*still*' also applies to not knowing why
