Bugs
=====
[*] Description doesn't scroll
[*] Feed grabbing thread will block if the HTTP connection blocks 
    (work in progress) FIXED with parallel feed grabbing
[ ] Sometimes (totally unreproducibly), the feeds file will be saved
    is the FeedList were an array, (not reproducible here)
[*] Sometimes (every time), the FeedList will be loaded as a Hash
    rather than a FeedList by ruby1.8/syck.  Not reproducible with syck
    0.35 under 1.6.  I'm tempted to blame syck, instrumented code
    clearly shows that it leaves us as a FeedList, stores as a
    FeedList and comes back as a Hash. (This *was* a bug in syck, ruby
    1.8.0-preview 3, the first to include YAML in the base, works just fine)
[ ] Code *very* untidy in places.
[ ] Man page is worthlessly incomplete
[*] It's possible that sometimes the inline documentation ("Raggle"
    feed) items aren't created from the default list (We can't even
    decide if this is really happenening or not. NOTABUG, removal of
    feed cache will remove items, items can't be refetched from this
    "internal" feed, only fix would be to either treat it as a special
    case (bad), or supply the help as an RSS feed (planned)
[-] I can *still* convince some feeds to flow description out of the
    window.  Unfortunately, the '*still*' also applies to not knowing
    why.  This appears not to happen under Linux (Linux also shows
    extra characters in the specific feed that I'm testing with,
    though I don't know if that's related), the behaviour being
    correct under Linux suggests either a curses bug in the platform
    I'm testing on, or Linux being kinder to the code in this specific
    case. (I can't reproduce this at all right now, but don't be
    fooled into thinking that means it's gone).
[*] One feed (actually, the same one that triggers the above) will
    reliably bend the description window over, and bugger it backwards
    with a steam iron.
[*] Long descriptions are *very* slow to scroll
[*] TextWindow#draw_items draws the title at x=1, but if the rest is
    drawn with x=1 it appears to be drawn one block to the right of the
    title.  Why? (workedaround, but very confusing).
[*] Various forms of output, will be very unhappy in an unquoted %
    appears in what's passed to them, unfortunately, I'm not sure
    which ones. (I've seen this once, but can't reproduce reliably).
[*] No HTTP grabbing in OSX (only one report, can't reproduce, might
    be bogus).  The error was "connection is already set up".
[-] Memory leak (might be fixed by GC thread; we'll have to wait
    and see). (don't think this is a mem leak; I think it's the feeds
    getting cached in memory).
[*] corrupting international characters? (see
    http://www.raggle.org/files/swedish_char_corruption/)
[ ] doesn't handle host relative URLs properly (reported by Harry Ohlsen
    <harryo@qiqsolutions.com>)
[*] some feeds report bizarre errors (reported by karl d'adamo
    <karld@ugcs.caltech.edu>):
    undefined method `write' for nil:NilClass
    malformed UTF-8 character
    undefined method `node_type' for #<REXML::Entity:0x4035f4f0>
    etc
    (a full list is available here:
    http://raggle.org/pipermail/raggle-dev/2003-September/000099.html)
[*] win32 installer doesn't work correctly on single-user systems
    (ENV['HOMEPATH'] isn't set)
[ ] win32 build doesn't handle setting a non C:\Program Files\Raggle
    install path gracefully (i think we can fix this and the bug above 
    by doing some sort of post-processing on raggle_server.bat, and
    setting the environment variables correctly before invoking Raggle)
[*] occasionally __ITEM_ID__ isn't expanded in the feed item list in the
    web interface
[*] when the active feed is updated it doesn't refresh the item window
[*] inconsistent theme color specification (some items take multiple
    attributes, some don't). reported by Phil Gregory
    <phil@mithrandir.aperiodic.net>
[ ] over-zealous UTF-8 mangling (reported by Gea-Suan Lin
    <gslin@ccca.nctu.edu.tw>). see
    http://raggle.org/pipermail/raggle-dev/2003-September/000146.html.
[*] some URLs don't load properly in ncurses interface (bug in command-
    line handling?) there was a post demonstrating this repeatedly on
    the mailing list on October, but I don't have the URL handy at the
    moment)
[ ] outstanding terminal resize / redraw bug
[*] parallel feed grabbing kills main feed grabbing thread, and
    sometimes Raggle along with it
[*] regex range warnings (reported by Brian Almeida)
[*] feed dates showed as timestamps
[ ] nil feed title empty borks sort (reported by Manpreet Singh
    <junkblocker@yahoo.com)
[ ] left pane isn't cleared when deleting last feed (reported by
    Manpreet Singh <junkblocker@yahoo.com)
