[*] Description doesn't scroll
[-] Feed grabbing thread will block if the HTTP connection blocks 
    (work in progress)
[ ] Sometimes (totally unreproducibly), the feeds file will be saved
    is the FeedList were an array, (not reproducible here)
[ ] Sometimes (every time), the FeedList will be loaded as a Hash
    rather than a FeedList by ruby1.8/syck.  Not reproducible with syck
    0.35 under 1.6.  I'm tempted to blame syck, instrumented code
    clearly shows that it leaves us as a FeedList, stores as a
    FeedList and comes back as a Hash.
[ ] Code *very* untidy in places, (will be fixed post-release)
[ ] Man page is worthlessly incomplete
[ ] It's possible that sometimes the inline documentation ("Raggle"
    feed) items aren't created from the default list (We can't even
    decide if this is really happenening or not.
[ ] I can *still* convince some feeds to flow description out of the
    window.  Unfortunately, the '*still*' also applies to not knowing
    why.  This appears not to happen under Linux (Linux also shows
    extra characters in the specific feed that I'm testing with,
    though I don't know if that's related), the behaviour being
    correct under Linux suggests either a curses bug in the platform
    I'm testing on, or Linux being kinder to the code in this specific case.
[ ] One feed (actually, the same one that triggers the above) will
    reliably bend the description window over, and bugger it backwards
    with a steam iron.
