Raggle TODO
===========
[*] scrolling
[ ] sanitize window modes (remove text reflow from draw())
[ ] clean up code (move methods to modules, eliminate globals, etc)
[ ] modularize code to make it suitable for reuse
[ ] finish inline documentation
[*] command-line options
[*] feed grab save existing items
[*] speed up feed cache loading
[*] theme shouldn't save hard-coded window coordinates
[ ] scrolling in Description window
[ ] fix blocking for feed grabbing (grab feeds in parallel?)
[ ] Convert manpage (raggle.1) to -ms
[ ] Window resizing.
    Take a copy of ['theme']['window'], so we can resize without
    messing up the initial sizes (they need to be changed so
    resize_term knows what to do (not really, but still).
    We need to know *where* the windows are.
    For instance, in the default config, narrowing "Feeds" means
    widening the other two windows, and such.  This is all possible,
    right now.  But takes surgery, which can wait until morning, if
    you read this more than a week after I commit it, email me and
    tell me to at the very least ammend this, to say why it's taken so long
